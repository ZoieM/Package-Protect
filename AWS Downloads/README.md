**DISCLAIMER:** Generally speaking, it's very bad security practice to upload your public/private security keys & certificate to GitHub.

Here are a few reasons why we are breaking this security practice:

1. For the most part, *we aren't working with any sensitive data* (that isn't our own) *or any potentially dangerous technology*. And *we aren't working for a company* whose security we might be compromising.
1. At the time of writing, this GitHub repository is *private*, so they aren't easily accessible to anyone without our GitHub logins.
1. This is *prototype code, not production code*. Storing our security credentials in a secure location just isn't that important or relevant for our current level of development.

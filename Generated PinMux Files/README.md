File Descriptions:
+ Open `package-protect.syscfg` in the PinMux browser tool to change the design.
+ Read `summary.csv` if you want a quick reference about all the pins we are using.
+ `CC3220SF_LAUNCHXL.c` and `CC220SF_LAUNCHXL.h` are the generated code files. If you ever want to make an update using the PinMux tool, you'll need to manually replace the pre-existing files in the `AmazonFreeRTOS/demos/ti/cc3220_launchpad/common/application_code/ti_code/` directory.
